Guidelines to the CSV files -

1)The CSV file stores the coordinates of the camber line
2)Make sure to have a file named Airfoils in the same file where we have the code.
3)The CSV file must have only 2 columns, one corrosponds to the X coordinates of the camber line, labelled X and the other corrosponds to the Y coordinates of the camber line, labelled Y.
4)Ensure that the X and Y axes are scaled such that x varies from 0 to 100

We use some approximations such as-

The airfoil is considered to be thin such that the vortex of the top and the bottom surface can be merged into a single airfoil.
Angles of attack is small (<10degrees). Basically we avoid stalling the airfoil
The Resolution of calculations depends on the number of points that are put in the airfoil file
